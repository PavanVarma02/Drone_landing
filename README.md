This repository contains a Python script that connects to CoppeliaSim via the ZMQ Remote API to Drive a Pioneer P3‑DX differential-drive robot through a sequence of waypoints (pure‑pursuit‑style angular error reduction). Stream images from a vision sensor and detect ArUco markers in real time. Visually servo a Quadcopter (drone) to hover over an ArUco tag (ID 2) and execute a staged descent/landing using a PID‑like controller with a simple Kalman filter for pixel‑space smoothing.
